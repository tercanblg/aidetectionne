qxresearch AI is a research lab focused on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. Our team aspires to make discoveries that hold a broad impact, and at the core of our approach lies the sharing of our findings in the field. Our researchers regularly publish in academic journals, release projects as open source on GitHub, and apply these findings in practical applications.



### Setup 

 to install the dependencies and generate API keys and incorporate them with our applications. I've articulated the steps in text format here : 

- Install the dependencies following these steps : 

  - Star this repository (top right corner) 
  - <>Code > Download ZIP > Open cmd/terminal in that location
  - Run this command : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Replace API keys in `yml` files 

\* The setup for different projects might not be the same. Please refer to the individual setup guides given for each project.
